# Objectives

Point of these are to increase the difficulty step by step to arrive in a decent TCP chat.

1 - Simple server, client connects, reads hello world  
2 - Simple server, client SENDS msgs, client prints to its stdout and return the message duplicated to user  
3 - Server, client 1 connects and wait. Client 2 connets, sends message and it gets sent to client 1.  
4 - Server, 1 client, sends many messages (user input), server prints on its stdout and returns same msg.  
5 - Server, many clients write, all of them receive all msgs (1 room)  
6 - Full TCP chat. Create chats, join, etc...

<!-- Do something similar for websockets later -->
